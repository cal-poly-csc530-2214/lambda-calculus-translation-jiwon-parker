Team Member: Jiwon Lee, Parker Mitchell

This was our first time using Racket so we spent decent amount of time learning the syntax. We leveraged the starter code given by Professor Clements to serve as the foundation for our program. We were able to successfully get most of the rules of the grammar working at a basic level (nested arithmetic, creating python lambda functions, ifleq0). We could get python code working for these things, except for the apply. We spent a lot of time getting the other parts working and decided to stop there for sake of time.

We have several small test cases within our racket file, where the output is generated by simply running the file itself.

We found this to be a challenging yet motivating learning experience for both us, bringing together a wealth concepts we have learned from our 430 class and what we have discussed in 530 thus far. Overall, it was a tough but rewarding experience.
